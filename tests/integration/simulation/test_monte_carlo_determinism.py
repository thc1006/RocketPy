"""End-to-end determinism tests for ``MonteCarlo.simulate(random_seed=...)``.

With a fixed ``random_seed`` the generated random *inputs* are reproducible and
identical across serial and parallel execution and across any number of workers.
Each simulation index draws from its own child stream spawned from the run's root
seed, and ``SeedSequence.spawn`` is prefix-stable, so index ``i`` maps to the same
seed regardless of the worker that runs it. (The seed-handling helpers themselves
are unit tested in ``tests/unit/simulation/test_monte_carlo_determinism``.)

The trajectory integration (``Flight``) is stubbed: worker invariance is a
property of the *input sampling*, which happens before ``Flight`` is built, so a
stub keeps the runs fast while still driving the real serial and parallel loops.
Stubbing the module-level ``Flight`` symbol reaches the parallel workers only
under the ``fork`` start method, so the worker-invariance test skips otherwise and
is marked ``slow`` to match the other Monte Carlo multiprocessing tests.

A dedicated numpy-only rocket keeps the fork-based end-to-end test simple: it
gives the motor a single ``thrust_source`` so the run has no list-valued attribute
at all. List sampling is itself seeded now (it draws through the model generator,
not the stdlib ``random.choice``) and is covered directly in
``tests/unit/stochastic/test_stochastic_model``.

Seed derivation being independent of the multiprocessing start method (fork,
spawn or forkserver) is verified separately by
``test_seed_derivation_is_start_method_invariant``, which uses a top-level
picklable target so it is safe under ``spawn``/``forkserver`` -- unlike the
``Flight``-stub test above, which reaches workers only under ``fork``.
