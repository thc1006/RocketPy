"""What a worker does when something fails part way through.

A worker that dies has to leave three things true: the failure that started it
is the one that escapes, the shared mutex is not still held, and the error event
is set. Before this, a failure in the claim itself broke all three at once --
``sim_idx`` and ``inputs_json`` were only bound inside the loop, so the handler
raised ``UnboundLocalError`` over the real error while holding the mutex, and
``error_event.set()`` sat after the write that never ran.
