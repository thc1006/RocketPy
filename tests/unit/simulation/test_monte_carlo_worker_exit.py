"""The parent has to notice a worker that died without saying so.

``join()`` returns None however the child ended, so the shared error event was
the only signal the run had. A worker can leave without setting it: ``SystemExit``,
``os._exit``, a segfault in a native extension, a target that will not unpickle
under spawn, or the error handler of the worker itself failing. The exit status
is what separates those from a clean finish.
