"""What the run is allowed to call a success, and how it comes down when it is not.

The completeness check reads the two logs back and decides whether the run can
be reported as complete. Everything it accepts is a claim about the results, so
a row it cannot read, an index it cannot trust, or a file that disagrees with
its pair has to stop the run rather than be skipped past.

The shutdown tests cover the other half: a fleet where one worker is not coming
back has to be brought down in bounded time, and the failure that started it has
to survive that.
